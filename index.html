   <h1>Politics</h1>
     Politics (from Ancient Greek πολιτικά (politiká) 'affairs of the cities') is the set of activities that are associated with making decisions in groups, or other forms of power relations among individuals, such as the distribution of resources or status. a person who is professionally involved in politics, especially as a holder of an elected office.
   Politics is an exciting and versatile subject. Contrary to popular belief, it’s not confined to senates and debate chambers. It also takes place on the streets and in your home. You can even say that everything is political.
        
  Politics has so many areas to study—it may be hard to decide what to choose. Let’s see what interesting concepts you can focus on:
        
  <li>Government and all that concerns the state. It includes actions that involve state institutions and people serving them. You might want to concentrate on voting, transnational interactions, or acts of politicians.</li>
 <li>We’ve all heard that conflict is a healthy part of every relationship. Do you believe that politics should embrace the differences? Then you may want to study the mechanisms of protests and revolutions.</li>
   Or, you can focus on methods of nonviolent conflict resolution.
  <p> <h1>Footbal</h1>
  Football is one of the most popularly played games around the world. It is the most interesting and engaging as well as one of the oldest games in the world. This game requires a lot of enthusiasm and excitement, which is seen during tournaments and world cups in both players and spectators. It is a game of eleven players in a team where two teams play against each other. The game is named football because it is played by using their feet to pass the ball, and the use of hands is considered a foul.
  Among various popular games across the world, football is one of the most enthusiastic and energetic sports. This game is played between two teams, and each team has eleven members. A lot of football tournaments are held in various countries every year at the national and international levels. Every four years, the FIFA or Federation Internationale de Football Association conducts a world cup which is the most awaited championship. The game is called football because the ball is passed among the team members using their feet, and the use of the hand is considered a foul. This, however, is decided by the referee of the match. The International Football Association Board formulates rules that the players follow, and any contravention shall be considered a disqualification.
  </p>
  <p><h1>Films</h1>
        
   Films are made of scenes, which include not only dialogue, but also a myriad of technical elements. You should consider the entire experience. How does the lighting set the mood? How does a casting choice affect the way a character was portrayed? How does the music foreshadow the plot? How does the camera tell the story? When you begin writing, think of how an entire scene contributes to your thesis, with reference to the technical and the more literary elements alike.
  Do a little research on the film. Movie reviews written by <strong>professional</strong> critics are a good start because they give you an idea of what to look for. Once you know the reason why critics hated or loved it, you can look for that aspect of the movie when you watch it. The Internet Movie Database (www.imdb.com) is one reliable source with information about the director, actors, crew, and a short synopsis. However, don’t let a movie review overpower your interpretation of the film—what you write needs to be original.

    <h2 class="Watch">Watch</h2>
    <p class="Dance">A watch is a small clock carried or worn by a person. It makes it easy to see the time. It is also a fashion accessory for men and women, and expensive watches are designed for this purpose. A watch may be one of the few accessories worn by a person. A small, thin, golden band strapped to my wrist, the watch is a living creature; it has a face, hands, a heartbeat. It has its own mechanized mind, a willpower to keep ticking at the same pace despite the circumstances; some of the more durable watches even tick under water.
    Whether you want to time how long the journey takes to the baker's, exactly when you have to leave for your date, or even just check the passage of day - this is the technology you need! For most of the 20th Century, almost all men would have some kind of watch to tell the time.</p>
